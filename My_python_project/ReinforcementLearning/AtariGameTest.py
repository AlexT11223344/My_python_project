# Process for RL to play Atari game
'1. Choose a game, get the initial settings, in other word, s1(environment) and a1(action)'
'2. Q-learning, choose an action and calculate the reward, r1'
'3. Q-learning, simulate the next environment s2, base on the reward value r2 to update the Q-table'
'4. Iterate the process above, until the whole loop ended'

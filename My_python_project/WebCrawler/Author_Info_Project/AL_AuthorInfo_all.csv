His father died in an automobile accident when Agee was a child. Agee attended St. Andrews School in Sewanee, Tenn., where he met his lifelong mentor, Father James Harold Flye. He also attended Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, N.H., where he began writing poetry and short stories. Upon his graduation from Harvard in 1932, he moved to New York City to work for <em>Fortune</em> magazine. In 1936, <em>Fortune</em> sent Agee and photographer Walker Evans to Alabama to gather material for a story about tenant farmers. Although <em>Fortune</em> decided not to publish the article, Agee and Walker turned their material into a book, which was published in 1941 as <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>. </p><p>In 1939, Agee began to work for <em>Time</em> magazine, first writing book reviews, then movie reviews. In 1942, he also became the movie columnist for <em>The Nation</em>. Agee believed that film was the most important art form because it came the closest to portraying reality, both physical and psychological. In 1948, he resigned both magazine jobs to write novels and film scripts, including the scripts for <em>The African Queen</em> and <em>The Night of the Hunter</em>. In 1951, Agee suffered the first of many heart attacks, but he continued to write. He died in New York City in 1955, leaving an unfinished manuscript for a semi-autobiographical novel. His editors assembled the pieces of the manuscript and published it in 1957. This novel, <em>A Death in the Family</em>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1958. </p>","<p>In <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, Agee attempted to document both the lives of Alabama tenant farmers and his own efforts to convey those lives with respect and authenticity. Agee worked in many genres: poetry, novels, short stories, screenplays, and reviews. He tried to blend the portrayal of physical reality with that of psychological reality. </p>  ","  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

He had little formal education but did well in English composition and developed a love for the great English writers. At age fourteen, Baldwin began working as a courthouse clerk, and, in his late teens, he studied law with an uncle and a cousin. He could not get a license to practice, however, until he reached twenty-one. While waiting, Baldwin moved to Lexington, Va., to help his brother Cornelius publish a local newspaper. From there, he moved to Buchanan, Va., to start a newspaper with another man, but the paper soon failed. After turning twenty-one and obtaining his license to practice law, Baldwin decided that he might prosper financially in the Southwest. In 1836, he moved to DeKalb, Miss., to practice law. The practice was successful, but, in 1837, Baldwin moved to Gainesville, Ala., thinking that there was more financial opportunity in that state. He prospered as a lawyer and entered politics. Baldwin served a two-year term in the Alabama House of Representatives and was a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1848. He also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress in 1848. </p><p>In 1850, Baldwin moved his family to Livingston, Ala., where he practiced law and began writing a series of humorous sketches of the characters he had encountered in his early days of legal practice. These were published in the <em>Southern Literary Messenger</em>, whose publisher urged him to collect them in book form. <em>The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi</em> was published in 1853 and was an immediate success. Baldwin spent a brief time working in Mobile but soon returned to Livingston and began working on his second book, a collection of political portraits. Still seeking financial success, Baldwin left Alabama for San Francisco shortly before this book was published. His success as a lawyer there led to his election to the California Supreme Court, where he became an expert on land, mineral, and water rights and established a reputation for excellent legal writing. Early in 1864, Baldwin began writing another book, a serious look at the California boom years. The work was never finished, however. Later that year, Baldwin developed tetanus following minor surgery and died a few weeks later. </p>",<p>Joseph Glover Baldwin is a key figure in the genre of “Old Southwest” humor. His <em>The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi</em> contains many accurate observations of frontier life during a financial boom time. His stories tend to focus on the legal profession and are notable for their subtle humor and astute character analyses. </p>  ,"  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

From 1842-1845, Barr was a mathematics tutor at the University. He also studied law privately and was admitted to the bar. Barr began practicing law in 1845. He began writing for the <em>Tuscaloosa Observer</em> during this time. He ran for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1847 but was unsuccessful. When the Mexican War broke out, Barr recruited a company of soldiers from Alabama. He served as captain of this company from November 1847 through July 1848. </p><p>After his return from Mexico, Barr resumed his law practice and became editor of the <em>Tuscaloosa Observer</em>. He also wrote for the paper, and some of his stories were reprinted in larger newspapers. In October of 1855, one of his stories appeared in the national weekly <em>The Spirit of the Times</em> under the pen name, “Omega.” Barr’s stories were published nationally for several years. In 1857, Barr again ran for office, this time for the US House of Representatives. The four-way race was acrimonious, and Barr eventually withdrew. In 1858, President James Buchanan appointed Barr to serve as US Consul in Melbourne, Australia. Barr set sail for Australia but died of sunstroke before reaching his post. </p>",<p>John Gorman Barr’s stories of frontier life in Alabama are characteristic of the genre of “Old Southwest” humor. </p>  ,"  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

Bartram grew up on his father’s estate, a botanical garden and experimental farm. He was educated classically and had a talent for drawing and painting. As a youth, he accompanied his father on several plant-hunting expeditions, drawing the plants they encountered. After several failures at business, Bartram persuaded one of his father’s professional contacts in England to finance his own expedition in Florida to search for interesting plant specimens to send to Europe. </p><p>Bartram's trip lasted four years (1773-1777) and eventually included most of the Southeast. He developed an eye ailment while in Mobile, which probably contributed to his concluding the trip and returning home to Pennsylvania. His <em>Travels</em>, the story of his expedition, was first published in 1791, fourteen years after his return. Bartram spent the rest of his life at his father’s (later his brother’s) estate, working with plants. Pleading ill health, he turned down the offer of a botany professorship at the college that later became the University of Pennsylvania. At age sixty-six, he turned down an offer by President Thomas Jefferson to join what we now call the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Bartram died at age eighty-four while working in the garden. </p>","<p>Although Bartram’s <em>Travels</em> didn’t have much of an impact in the United States, it sold well in Europe. Bartram was one of the first to introduce the American southeastern “wilderness” to a European audience. Bartram’s work was also a bridge between the rationalism of the Enlightenment and the emotionalism of the Romantic Movement and  inspired several of the English Romantic poets, including Coleridge and Wordsworth. </p>  ","  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

His father, an executive with the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, moved the family to Birmingham, Ala., when Beecher was about three. Beecher graduated from high school at age fourteen, and for the next sixteen years alternated between working in the steel mills and taking classes. His experiences in the steel mills inspired him to begin writing poetry. Beecher graduated with an AB in English from the University of Alabama in 1926, completed an MA in English at the University of Wisconsin in 1930, and, in 1933, began graduate studies in sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 1934 through 1942, Beecher worked for various New Deal government agencies. He also took time off to write, including periods writing for the <em>Birmingham Age-Herald and News</em> and the <em>New York Post</em>. In 1943, Beecher joined the United States Merchant Marine and served two years on the <em>SS Booker T. Washington</em>, the first U.S. ship to have a racially integrated crew. His book <em>All Brave Sailors</em> is about that experience. In 1948, Beecher became an assistant professor of sociology at San Francisco State College but was fired in 1950 for refusing to sign a mandatory loyalty oath. He was awarded a Ford Foundation fellowship to study small farmers in California and, when this ended, he bought and ran a small ranch in Sonoma County. </p><p>In 1956, Beecher and his wife Barbara, a graphic artist, started Morning Star Press at the ranch, then moved it to Arizona in 1958 and renamed it Rampart Press. The press printed Beecher's poetry and that of other blacklisted poets. In 1964, Beecher and his wife moved to the Southeast and began actively participating in civil rights activities. He was publicly denounced by Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace for his participation in the Selma to Montgomery March. In 1966, he published <em>To Live and Die in Dixie</em>, a collection of poems about his life in the segregated South. In the late 1960s, the Beechers began traveling around the country, he giving lectures and poetry readings and she selling copies of his books. He also served as poet-in-residence for several institutions (while maintaining a residence in Burnsville, N.C.) and received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1977, Beecher was rehired by San Francisco State College, ten years after the loyalty oath law was determined by the courts to be unconstitutional. He taught there briefly before his death from lung disease in 1980. </p>","<p>John Beecher's poetry is an expression of his political and social activism. His powerful and accessible poems about working people and the disadvantaged make use of common speech patterns and dialect. Some of his work deals with Alabama subjects, including “In Egypt Land,” an epic poem about an Alabama sharecroppers’ union. </p>  ","  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

He majored in English and worked part time at the Birmingham Public Library. In 1947, Bell's family moved to Fairhope, Ala., but he continued his studies at BSC, graduating in 1950 with a BA in English.

Bell began working on a novel set in Fairhope while he was commuting from there to his job in Mobile.

His father’s career as a geologist took the family to Manchester, Kentucky and Tulsa, Oklahoma, before they returned to Alabama and settled in Decatur. Bensko attended St. Louis University, Auburn University, and the University of Alabama, where he earned a B.A. and an MFA. He studied at Florida State University for his Ph.D., writing his dissertation on “Narrative in the Modern Short Poem.” His debut volume poetry, Green Soldiers, was chosen by Richard Hugo for the Yale Younger Poets Series.Bensko taught at Old Dominion University and later at Rhodes College, where he established the creative writing program. Currently he is Professor of English at the University of Memphis, where he has developed the MFA and the undergraduate creative writing programs. Through the Study Abroad Office, he has launched a summer program in creative writing at the Universidad de Alicante.He is married to the fiction writer Cary Holladay and has a son, Thomas Bensko, from a previous marriage.</p>","<p>Bensko’s first volume of poetry, Green Soldiers, was inspired by his interest in the Great War. Subsequent books reflect themes of marriage and family (The Waterman’s Children) and the writer’s ongoing involvement with the history and culture of the American South, particularly his native Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The Iron City draws on his paternal grandparents’ life in the village of Brookside; during Bensko’s childhood, Brookside residents still spoke Slovak, having emigrated from eastern Europe to mine Alabama’s coal and iron ore.Throughout John Bensko’s work, the personal experience evokes the historical past. “Coal, the rock that burns...” muses the narrator of “Late Shift,” recalling the smoke that pervaded his childhood home. Through metaphors of metal and industry, the  poems expose the brutal effects of mining - its “muddy slag” - in counterpoint to a young narrator’s attempt to understand his secretive elders’ belief that “Knives and spoons / must never cross.”</p><p>A recent series of poems inspired by American landscape paintings explores westward migration. A hallmark of Bensko’s work is the singular experience rooted in historical and often tragic fact, such as that of a family swept away, house and all, by avalanche (“The Great Slide,” The Yale Review 91:3, July 2003.)Bensko’s fiction shows innovation in voice and narrative form. The stories in Sea Dogs are linked by water. Fishermen and fugitives populate tales of chance encounter, desperate love, and violent impulse. In “The Ocean,” a young boy, maddened by love for a motel chambermaid, confronts a guest bent on murder-by-scorpion. In the title story, a man with a pirate’s swagger and a lover’s heart has the chance to rescue or destroy a fellow outlaw.</p>  ","  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

After graduating, Bethea continued as a reporter with the <em>Age-Herald</em> until 1916, when he became the city editor of <em>The Birmingham Ledger</em>. When the <em>Ledger</em> closed, he worked at a local department store briefly. In 1921, when <em>The Birmingham Post</em> started publication, Bethea was hired as a managing editor. In addition to his journalism career, he also wrote fiction and was a member of the Loafers' Club, a group of Birmingham writers. </p> <p>Bethea's short stories and serial forms of his novels were published in national magazines such as <em>Collier's</em>. After the publication of his first novel, <em>Bed Rock</em>, in 1924, Bethea took six months off from the newspaper to work on another one. He returned to the <em>Post</em> as news editor and later became managing editor, then editor in 1927. Bethea published four novels between 1924 and 1928. Two were made into motion pictures: <em>Coming Through</em> (from his novel <em>Bed Rock</em>) in 1925 and <em>Honor Bound</em> in 1928. That same year, Bethea became despondent over his slow recovery from an illness. In July 1928, he committed suicide in a downtown Birmingham hotel. </p>","<p>Three of Jack Bethea's novels concern the coal mining industry. <em>Honor Bound</em> specifically addresses the convict-lease system.

When he was four, Bontemps’s family moved to southern California. Bontemps did well in school there and read voraciously. He attended the San Fernando Academy and majored in English at Pacific Union College. After graduating in 1923 with an AB degree, Bontemps worked at the Los Angeles Post Office and wrote poetry in his spare time. After one of his poems was published in <em>The Crisis</em> in 1924, Bontemps moved to New York City. He btained a teaching job at Harlem Academy and made connections with the writers, artists, and musicians of the Harlem Renaissance. In 1926 and 1927, his poems won prizes sponsored by <em>Opportunity</em> and <em>The Crisis</em> magazines. Bontemps married in 1926, and the first of his six children was born the following year. His first novel <em>God Sends Sunday</em> was published in 1931. Harlem Academy closed that year, and Bontemps accepted a position at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala. His first children’s books, <em>Popo and Fifina</em> (a collaboration with Langston Hughes) and <em>You Can’t Pet a Possum</em>, were published while he was in Alabama. Bontemps had difficulties with college administrators who thought he was a radical. He resigned in 1934 and moved his family to California where they lived for a year with his father. </p><p>In 1935, Bontemps sold his novel <em>Black Thunder</em> (published in 1936) and moved with his family to Chicago. He was principal of Shiloh Academy until 1937, when he obtained a fellowship from the Julius Rosenwald Fund to do research in the Caribbean. (His novel <em>Drums at Dusk</em> was published in 1939.) On his return, he worked for the WPA Federal Writer’s Project in Chicago. In 1942, Bontemps enrolled in library school at the University of Chicago, supporting his family with a second Rosenwald Fund fellowship. He accepted a position at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., in 1943. For the next twenty-three years, Bontemps was Head Librarian at Fisk, using his Harlem Renaissance connections to acquire materials by and about black writers, artists, and musicians. He also taught creative writing classes and continued his own writing, publishing nonfiction books for adults and both fiction and nonfiction books for children. Some of these works were collaborations with writers Langston Hughes and Jack Conroy. Bontemps also edited anthologies of black poetry and folklore, often in collaboration with Hughes. He also received Carnegie and Guggenheim research grants. In 1966, the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle recruited Bontemps to teach American literature. In his second year there, he suffered a stroke and had to return to Nashville. After recovering, he taught at Yale University for two years. In 1971, Bontemps returned to Nashville to become Writer-in-Residence at Fisk. He began doing research for an autobiography but never began writing it. He died of a heart attack in Nashville in 1973 and is buried there. </p>","<p>Arna Bontemps wrote poetry, fiction, and nonfiction for both children and adults about the black experience in the United States and the Caribbean. Several of his children’s books (<em>You Can’t Pet a Possum</em>, <em>Sad-Faced Boy</em>, and <em>Mr. Kelso’s Lion</em>) are based on his experiences in Alabama. His short story ""A Summer Tragedy"" is also set in Alabama. </p>  ","  <p>Please check your local library for these materials.

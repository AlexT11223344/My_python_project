"James Agee (November 27, 1909&ndash;May 16, 1955)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/ageejam.jpg,"James Agee was born in Knoxville, Tenn., and spent his early childhood there. His father died in an automobile accident when Agee was a child. Agee attended St. Andrews School in Sewanee, Tenn., where he met his lifelong mentor, Father James Harold Flye. He also attended Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, N.H., where he began writing poetry and short stories. Upon his graduation from Harvard in 1932, he moved to New York City to work for <em>Fortune</em> magazine. In 1936, <em>Fortune</em> sent Agee and photographer Walker Evans to Alabama to gather material for a story about tenant farmers. Although <em>Fortune</em> decided not to publish the article, Agee and Walker turned their material into a book, which was published in 1941 as <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>. </p>
<p>In 1939, Agee began to work for <em>Time</em> magazine, first writing book reviews, then movie reviews. In 1942, he also became the movie columnist for <em>The Nation</em>. Agee believed that film was the most important art form because it came the closest to portraying reality, both physical and psychological. In 1948, he resigned both magazine jobs to write novels and film scripts, including the scripts for <em>The African Queen</em> and <em>The Night of the Hunter</em>. In 1951, Agee suffered the first of many heart attacks, but he continued to write. He died in New York City in 1955, leaving an unfinished manuscript for a semi-autobiographical novel. His editors assembled the pieces of the manuscript and published it in 1957. This novel, <em>A Death in the Family</em>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1958."

"Joseph Glover Baldwin (January 21, 1815&ndash;September 30, 1864)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/baldwjg.jpg,"Joseph Glover Baldwin was born in Friendly Grove Factory in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. He had little formal education but did well in English composition and developed a love for the great English writers. At age fourteen, Baldwin began working as a courthouse clerk, and, in his late teens, he studied law with an uncle and a cousin. He could not get a license to practice, however, until he reached twenty-one. While waiting, Baldwin moved to Lexington, Va., to help his brother Cornelius publish a local newspaper. From there, he moved to Buchanan, Va., to start a newspaper with another man, but the paper soon failed. After turning twenty-one and obtaining his license to practice law, Baldwin decided that he might prosper financially in the Southwest. In 1836, he moved to DeKalb, Miss., to practice law. The practice was successful, but, in 1837, Baldwin moved to Gainesville, Ala., thinking that there was more financial opportunity in that state. He prospered as a lawyer and entered politics. Baldwin served a two-year term in the Alabama House of Representatives and was a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1848. He also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress in 1848. </p>
<p>In 1850, Baldwin moved his family to Livingston, Ala., where he practiced law and began writing a series of humorous sketches of the characters he had encountered in his early days of legal practice. These were published in the <em>Southern Literary Messenger</em>, whose publisher urged him to collect them in book form. <em>The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi</em> was published in 1853 and was an immediate success. Baldwin spent a brief time working in Mobile but soon returned to Livingston and began working on his second book, a collection of political portraits. Still seeking financial success, Baldwin left Alabama for San Francisco shortly before this book was published. His success as a lawyer there led to his election to the California Supreme Court, where he became an expert on land, mineral, and water rights and established a reputation for excellent legal writing. Early in 1864, Baldwin began writing another book, a serious look at the California boom years. The work was never finished, however. Later that year, Baldwin developed tetanus following minor surgery and died a few weeks later."
"John Gorman Barr (November 22, 1823&ndash;May 18, 1858)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/barrjoh.jpg,"John Gorman Barr was born in Milton, N.C., but his family soon moved to Raleigh. His father died when Barr was three, and his mother died shortly after moving the family to Tuscaloosa, Ala., in 1835. Barr was apprenticed to a Tuscaloosa printer, but, in 1838, a local merchant arranged for him to enter the University of Alabama as a scholarship student. Barr earned an AB in 1841 and an MA in 1842. From 1842-1845, Barr was a mathematics tutor at the University. He also studied law privately and was admitted to the bar. Barr began practicing law in 1845. He began writing for the <em>Tuscaloosa Observer</em> during this time. He ran for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1847 but was unsuccessful.

He also wrote for the paper, and some of his stories were reprinted in larger newspapers. In October of 1855, one of his stories appeared in the national weekly <em>The Spirit of the Times</em> under the pen name, “Omega.” Barr’s stories were published nationally for several years. In 1857, Barr again ran for office, this time for the US House of Representatives. The four-way race was acrimonious, and Barr eventually withdrew. In 1858, President James Buchanan appointed Barr to serve as US Consul in Melbourne, Australia. Barr set sail for Australia but died of sunstroke before reaching his post."

Bartram grew up on his father’s estate, a botanical garden and experimental farm. He was educated classically and had a talent for drawing and painting. As a youth, he accompanied his father on several plant-hunting expeditions, drawing the plants they encountered. After several failures at business, Bartram persuaded one of his father’s professional contacts in England to finance his own expedition in Florida to search for interesting plant specimens to send to Europe. </p>
<p>Bartram's trip lasted four years (1773-1777) and eventually included most of the Southeast. He developed an eye ailment while in Mobile, which probably contributed to his concluding the trip and returning home to Pennsylvania. His <em>Travels</em>, the story of his expedition, was first published in 1791, fourteen years after his return. Bartram spent the rest of his life at his father’s (later his brother’s) estate, working with plants. Pleading ill health, he turned down the offer of a botany professorship at the college that later became the University of Pennsylvania. At age sixty-six, he turned down an offer by President Thomas Jefferson to join what we now call the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Bartram died at age eighty-four while working in the garden."
"John Beecher (January 22, 1904&ndash;May 11, 1980)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/beechj2.jpg,"John Beecher, a descendant of the Rev. Lyman Beecher and  related to Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, was born in New York. His father, an executive with the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, moved the family to Birmingham, Ala., when Beecher was about three. Beecher graduated from high school at age fourteen, and for the next sixteen years alternated between working in the steel mills and taking classes. His experiences in the steel mills inspired him to begin writing poetry. Beecher graduated with an AB in English from the University of Alabama in 1926, completed an MA in English at the University of Wisconsin in 1930, and, in 1933, began graduate studies in sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 1934 through 1942, Beecher worked for various New Deal government agencies. He also took time off to write, including periods writing for the <em>Birmingham Age-Herald and News</em> and the <em>New York Post</em>. In 1943, Beecher joined the United States Merchant Marine and served two years on the <em>SS Booker T. Washington</em>, the first U.S. ship to have a racially integrated crew. His book <em>All Brave Sailors</em> is about that experience. In 1948, Beecher became an assistant professor of sociology at San Francisco State College but was fired in 1950 for refusing to sign a mandatory loyalty oath. He was awarded a Ford Foundation fellowship to study small farmers in California and, when this ended, he bought and ran a small ranch in Sonoma County. </p>
<p>In 1956, Beecher and his wife Barbara, a graphic artist, started Morning Star Press at the ranch, then moved it to Arizona in 1958 and renamed it Rampart Press. The press printed Beecher's poetry and that of other blacklisted poets. In 1964, Beecher and his wife moved to the Southeast and began actively participating in civil rights activities. He was publicly denounced by Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace for his participation in the Selma to Montgomery March. In 1966, he published <em>To Live and Die in Dixie</em>, a collection of poems about his life in the segregated South. In the late 1960s, the Beechers began traveling around the country, he giving lectures and poetry readings and she selling copies of his books. He also served as poet-in-residence for several institutions (while maintaining a residence in Burnsville, N.C.) and received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1977, Beecher was rehired by San Francisco State College, ten years after the loyalty oath law was determined by the courts to be unconstitutional. He taught there briefly before his death from lung disease in 1980."

In 1933, Capote moved to New York to live with his mother and her second husband, who eventually adopted him. Capote always knew that he would become a writer and began writing stories as a child. He was encouraged in his ambitions by one of his high school teachers, Miss Catherine Wood. Capote decided not to attend college and got a job at <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine as a copyboy and messenger. <em>The New Yorker</em> refused to publish his short stories, but he was able to make helpful contacts in the New York literary world. Capote's big break came when <em>Mademoiselle</em> published his short story ""Miriam."" He obtained a residency at Yaddo, an artists’ and writers’ colony in upstate New York, where he worked on his writing and made more literary contacts. His first novel, <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em>, was published in 1948. </p>
<p>Capote had difficulty writing at his parents’ home in New York and began living and working in Europe for extended periods of time. He also experimented with different forms of writing. In addition to his short stories and novels, Capote wrote travel articles and portraits of celebrities for popular magazines which were later collected and published in book form. He adapted two of his stories for the stage and wrote the screenplay for the film <em>Beat the Devil</em>. In 1959, Capote saw a newspaper account of a set of murders in a small Kansas town. He thought the story would make a good subject for a type of work he called the ""nonfiction novel."" He and his friend <a href=""http://media.cla.auburn.edu/goodlyland/author.cfm?AuthorID=19"">Harper Lee</a> went out to Kansas to do research. The book that resulted from this work, <em>In Cold Blood</em>, took six years to complete. It was immensely successful and left him financially well off but emotionally depleted. He continued writing, but his work was less successful, impaired at least partially by drug and alcohol abuse. In the mid-1970s, <em>Esquire</em> published several chapters of a proposed new book to be called <em>Answered Prayers</em>. The characters were thinly disguised versions of Capote’s celebrity friends, who were outraged at the invasion of their privacy. Cast out of the ""jet set,"" he continued to work, but his abuse of drugs and alcohol caused both his writing and his health to deteriorate. While staying at the home of a friend, he died from complications of liver disease."
"Carl Carmer (October 16, 1893&ndash;September 11, 1976)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/carmeca.jpg,"Carl Carmer was born and raised in rural upstate New York.

Carmer then taught English at Syracuse University and the University of Rochester and served as an artillery instructor at Fort Sill, Okla., during World War I. From 1921 to 1927, Carmer taught English at the University of Alabama. He began studying Alabama, traveling around the state and making notes on the folklore and the people, intending to write a scholarly paper about what he observed. In 1927, Carmer left the university and took a job as columnist and reporter for the <em>New Orleans Item-Tribune</em>. The following year, he became an assistant editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em> in New York. In 1929, Carmer became an assistant editor at <em>Theatre Arts Monthly</em>. In 1930, he published a book of poetry based on Alabama locales called <em>Deep South</em>. </p>
<p>In 1933, Carmer lost his editing job and decided to focus on a prose book he was writing about his experiences in Alabama. Residencies at Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony helped support him during this period. <em>Stars Fell on Alabama</em> was published in 1934 and quickly became a bestseller. Similar books about New York State folklore followed, the first appearing in 1936. In 1937, Carmer told American folktales on a radio show called <em>Your Neck o’ the Woods</em> and published a collection of stories from that program, <em>The Hurricane’s Children</em>. In the late 1940s, Carmer began writing children’s books, many of which were illustrated by his wife Elizabeth.

After high school, Carter enlisted in the US Navy and was trained at the University of Colorado to be a radioman, serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II. After his discharge, Carter worked as a radio announcer in Denver until 1952, when he returned to Alabama. He worked in Birmingham as the radio spokesman for the American States Rights Association, until he was fired for offending local Jewish leaders during National Brotherhood Week. With a friend, Carter published a segregationist magazine, <em>The Southerner</em>. He also started a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan whose members conducted the kidnapping, beating, and castration of Edward Aaron in 1957. In 1962, Carter began working as a speechwriter for George C. Wallace during his first run for governor. Wallace’s 1963 inaugural speech, best remembered for the line “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,” was written by Carter. By 1970, however, Carter was impatient with Wallace’s “liberal” views and ran for governor himself, finishing last. In 1972, he sold his farm and disappeared from public life. </p>
<p>Carter reappeared in 1973, calling himself Bedford Forrest Carter and claiming to be a half-Cherokee cowboy who had been born in Tennessee. His book, <em>The Rebel Outlaw, Josey Wales</em>, was published privately in 1973 and republished by Delacorte as <em>Gone to Texas</em> later that same year. The actor Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the movie version, <em>The Outlaw Josey Wales</em>, which was released in 1976. A mid-1970s television interview led some Alabamians to connect Forrest Carter the novelist with Asa Earl Carter the politician, a connection Carter himself denied. In 1976, Carter published two more novels, <em>The Education of Little Tree</em> (which he claimed was autobiographical) and a Josey Wales sequel. Both were filmed after Carter’s death. The former was released in 1997, while the latter was released in 1986 as <em>The Return of Josey Wales</em>. His last novel was a Western about the Apache leader Geronimo. Carter died in Abilene, Texas, while visiting one of his sons."

She grew up in Mobile and was educated at the Irving Female Institute. Fenollosa’s family struggled financially during her childhood. In addition to her father’s various jobs as private secretary, botanist, and cartographer, both parents wrote for newspapers and magazines. Fenollosa began writing for publication when she became widowed at the age of 20 and returned home to live with her parents. She remarried in 1890 and moved to Japan where her husband was living. While there, Fenollosa studied the Japanese language and culture. After the failure of the marriage, she returned to Mobile in 1892 but retained her interest in Japan. She continued to write and was published in nationally distributed publications such as <em>The Century</em>, <em>Lippincott’s</em>, <em>St. Nicholas</em>, and <em>Scribner’s</em>. In 1894, Fenollosa moved to Boston to work at the Museum of Fine Arts as an assistant to Ernest Fenollosa, an expert in Oriental art. They married in 1895 and moved to Japan in 1897. </p>
<p>While there, Fenollosa published a collection of her poems under a variation of her real name (she dropped an “l” from her maiden name at her mother’s suggestion). Prompted by homesickness, she also wrote a novel based in Mobile, <em>Truth Dexter</em>, which she published under the pen name Sidney McCall. Fenollosa and her husband returned to the United States to be closer to her children who were attending U.S. schools. She was again moved by homesickness to write, this time a novel based in Japan. Another Japan-based novel was an expansion of the short story with which Fenollosa won a contest sponsored by <em>Collier’s</em> magazine. After her husband’s death in 1909, Fenollosa devoted herself to editing his life’s work, a collection of material on Oriental art. This work was published as <em>Epochs of Chinese and Japanese Art</em>. The project took three years to complete and drained her finances. Fenollosa was forced to sell her husband’s Oriental art collection and the Mobile property which she had purchased with the money from <em>Truth Dexter</em>.  The project also drained her creativity. She wrote a few more novels, but they were unsuccessful. Fenollosa spent much of the rest of her life living with her children and did not return to Alabama until shortly before her death. Several of her novels were made into silent movies."

She read widely growing up but had little interest in school and preferred to focus on her social life. Zelda graduated from Sidney Lanier High School in 1918. That summer, she began dating F. Scott Fitzgerald, a soldier stationed in the Montgomery area, whom she had met at a local dance. Although Scott wanted to marry her, Zelda’s parents doubted his ability to support her. After Scott published <em>This Side of Paradise</em>, Zelda joined him in New York, where they married in 1920. The couple entered New York literary society and became publicly identified with the 1920s “Jazz Age,” on the basis of Scott’s writing and their party-filled lifestyle. Scott’s fiction made extensive use of Zelda’s diary and letters, and he patterned many of his heroines on her. Zelda herself began writing articles and short stories on “flappers,” which were published under both their names or under Scott’s name alone. </p>
<p>Through the 1920s and into the early 1930s, the Fitzgeralds moved frequently between Europe and the United States. Zelda continued her writing and took up painting and ballet, hoping to become a professional dancer. In 1930, however, Zelda entered a Swiss mental health clinic where she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Although she spent most of the rest of her life in mental health facilities, she continued to write. In 1931, the Fitzgeralds returned to the United States and rented a house in Montgomery so that Zelda could be near her family. She had several breakdowns in early 1932 and entered a psychiatric hospital in Maryland. At the Maryland hospital, Zelda completed her novel, <em>Save Me the Waltz</em>, and collected her short stories and articles for publication in book form. From 1936 until her death in 1948, Zelda divided her time between Highland Hospital in Asheville, N.C., and her mother’s home in Montgomery. When Scott died in November of 1940, Zelda was too ill to attend his funeral. She died on March 10, 1948, trapped in a fire at Highland Hospital."

His father was a painter, and Gosse taught himself to draw by watching his father work. Gosse had little formal education but read widely, borrowing books from friends and neighbors. In 1827, he took a job as a clerk in Newfoundland, Canada. Gosse studied the natural history of Newfoundland and joined the local book and debating societies. He also converted to Methodism there and preached locally on occasion. In 1835, he and a couple of friends bought a farm in Lower Canada. Gosse worked on the farm, taught school in the winter months, and continued his studies of natural history. He wasn’t suited to farming, however, and sold out in 1838. Gosse left Canada and traveled to Alabama, where he was engaged to teach school in Pleasant Hill. He enjoyed his studies of the natural history there, but he was bothered by the heat and humidity, and slavery disturbed him spiritually. Gosse left Alabama after eight months and returned to England where he settled in London. There, Gosse taught school and wrote and published articles in scientific journals. He also began writing natural history books. <em>The Canadian Naturalist</em>, a compilation of his observations in Newfoundland and Lower Canada, was published in 1840. Gosse continued his religious journey in London as well, converting from Methodism to a stricter sect, the Plymouth Brethren. </p>
<p>In 1844, Gosse sailed to Jamaica where he spent eighteen months studying the local natural history. On his return to London, Gosse used his notes and illustrations in two books on Jamaican natural history. His books began to bring in enough income that he could focus on his writing and his scientific studies. In 1852, Gosse and his family moved to the Devon coast for the sake of his health. He expanded his work to include marine natural history and began teaching field classes in the subject. His book, <em>The Aquarium</em>, popularized these installations for both private homes and institutions such as zoos and museums. In 1855, Gosse’s <em>Letters from Alabama</em> was published in serial form in <em>The Home Friend</em> magazine. (It was published in book form in 1859.) Gosse’s strong religious beliefs prompted him to attempt to reconcile the Biblical creation story with the fossil record which was being discovered at the time. <em>Omphalos</em>, published in 1857, asserted that God had created the fossils along with the rest of the world and had embedded them in the earth’s crust as a puzzle for scientists. The book sold poorly and was widely criticized. Despite the damage to his scientific reputation, Gosse continued publishing and teaching. His last books appeared in 1865, but he continued to publish articles in scientific journals. He also wrote and published religious materials. In late 1887, Gosse developed bronchitis, and he died the following August."

He was a voracious reader and was interested in journalism. As a teenager, Hasford edited and wrote for his school newspaper and worked part-time for two area papers, the <em>Franklin County Times</em> in Russellville and <em>The Northwest Alabamian</em> in Haleyville. He started a national magazine for writers, <em>Freelance</em>, at age fifteen but was forced to discontinue it after a few issues. Several years later, Hasford left high school and joined the U.S. Marines, where he served as a military journalist in Vietnam. After his discharge in 1968, Hasford moved with his parents to Longview, Wash. He worked at a variety of jobs and took courses at Lower Columbia Community College but spent much of his time reading and writing. Two of his short stories were published in the college literary magazine <em>Mirror Northwest</em>. In the early 1970s, Hasford moved to Southern California, where he supported himself with whatever jobs he could find and worked on a novel about his Vietnam experience. </p>
<p><em>The Short-Timers</em> was published in 1979, ten years after Hasford had begun writing it, and was well received by critics. In 1982, director Stanley Kubrick bought the movie rights, and Hasford used the money to move to Australia, where he lived from 1982 to 1983. He returned to California briefly, then moved to London to work with Kubrick and writer Michael Herr on the screenplay. The movie version, <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>, was released in 1987. The following year, police in San Luis Obispo, Calif., discovered approximately eight hundred stolen library books in a storage locker rented to Hasford. Hasford served three months of a six-month jail sentence for possession of stolen property. After his release, Hasford lived briefly in California, before moving to Tacoma, Wash., to be near his mother. In the early 1990s, Hasford published a sequel to <em>The Short-Timers</em> and a third novel. He moved to Greece in 1992. Hasford’s health had begun to deteriorate during his time in jail, and he died in Greece in early 1993."

Because he was black, he couldn’t check books out from the public library, so his mother bought him a supermarket encyclopedia one volume at a time. Later, a white woman who knew his mother checked out books for him. When Haskins was a teen, his parents separated, and he moved with his mother to Boston, where he was admitted to the highly competitive Boston Latin School.

He then attended Georgetown University, earning a BA in psychology in 1960. He returned to Alabama State, earning a BS in history in 1962, and then went on to the University of New Mexico, where he earned an MA in social psychology in 1963. </p>
<p>Haskins worked briefly in New York City as a stock trader but felt unfulfilled. He began teaching at a public school in Harlem in 1966. He kept a journal of his experiences, creating from it the book <em>Diary of a Harlem School Teacher</em>, published in 1969. He was then approached to write books for younger readers. His first book for children, <em>Resistance: Profiles in Nonviolence</em>, was published in 1970. He eventually wrote over one hundred nonfiction books, for both younger readers and adults, and won many awards. However, Haskins considered himself a teacher first and a writer second. From 1970 to 1977, he taught at the Staten Island Community College of the City University of New York. From 1977 until his death in 2005, Haskins was a professor of English at the University of Florida, Gainesville."

Until the 1950s, she lived and worked in both New York and Hollywood and wrote both plays and screenplays. Hellman was active in leftist political causes. In 1952, she was accused of being a Communist and subpoenaed to appear before the U.S. Congress House Un-American Activities Committee. Fearing that an open discussion of her own activities would force her to name others, Hellman pled the Fifth Amendment. She was blacklisted and could no longer write for Hollywood, although she continued to write plays, some of which she also directed. In the late 1960s, Hellman ceased writing plays and began writing her memoirs, one of which, <em>Scoundrel Time</em>, was her version of the events of the McCarthy era.  A chapter from another of her memoirs, <em>Pentimento</em>, was made into the motion picture <em>Julia</em>."

Hurston was thirteen when her mother died. Her father sent her to boarding school in Jacksonville, Fla., where she encountered Jim Crow segregation for the first time. When she returned home, Hurston was unable to get along with her new stepmother and left. In 1915, Hurston joined a traveling theater troupe as a maid and dresser. In 1917, she left the troupe in Baltimore, where she lied about her age (taking off ten years) in order to qualify for a free high school education. A year later, she moved to Washington, DC, where she finished her high school diploma at Howard Academy, then enrolled in college classes at Howard University. Hurston began writing at Howard and published her first short story in the university literary magazine. In 1925, she moved to New York and became involved with the artists and writers collectively known as the Harlem Renaissance. She impressed people with her work so much that she was given a scholarship to Barnard College, where she earned a BA in 1928. While at Barnard, she developed an interest in anthropology, and, both before and after graduation, she made trips to the southern United States and the Bahamas, collecting black folklore material. </p>
<p>In 1932, Hurston returned to Florida to live and write. She published a book of folk stories and her first novel and continued to pursue her interest in anthropology. In 1936 and 1937, she received back-to-back Guggenheim Fellowships for travel to Jamaica and Haiti to study voodoo practices. On her return, she published her findings in a book. She also wrote two more novels and an autobiography, along with numerous articles and short stories. In 1947, she traveled to Honduras to write another novel and to study the folklore there. Upon her return to New York in 1948, her life was shattered by a false accusation of child molestation. Because she was able to prove that she was out of the country when most of the alleged acts were said to have taken place, her accusers were discredited and the charges dismissed. The national publicity, however, devastated her personally and severely damaged her career. Hurston returned to Florida and worked at whatever jobs she could find: maid, schoolteacher, librarian, newspaper reporter, and ghostwriter. She continued to publish occasional articles and short stories, but all her subsequent novels were rejected by her publisher. Late in 1959, she suffered a stroke and was placed in a nursing home. She died there in early 1960 after a second stroke."

Ingraham was born in Portland, Maine, and grew up in Hallowell, Maine. He graduated from Hallowell Academy and attended Yale College (now Yale University) for a year. In 1830, Ingraham sailed to New Orleans and traveled upriver to Natchez, Miss. He became a teacher at Jefferson College in Washington, Miss., and married the daughter of a Mississippi planter. A series of letters he wrote about the trip were published in the <em>Natchez Courier</em> from 1833 to 1835. These were collected and published as <em>The South-West</em> in 1835. The book sold well and was liked by critics. Ingraham began publishing articles and short stories in regional and national periodicals such as <em>The Ladies’ Companion</em>. His first novel, <em>Lafitte</em> (published in 1836), was an immediate success, and he published three more novels in the next three years. Despite their success, Ingraham had financial difficulties and went bankrupt in 1842. In an attempt to make more money, he began serializing his novels in popular magazines before publishing them in book form. He produced over seventy-five novels in six years. </p>
<p>In 1847, Ingraham decided to become an Episcopal minister and moved to Nashville to study theology. To support his family, he ran a girls’ school. He also established a prison ministry at the state penitentiary, leading Bible study and teaching reading classes. Ingraham was made a deacon in 1851 and was assigned to a cluster of mission churches in Mississippi. After his ordination to the priesthood, he became the parish priest of a church in Aberdeen, Miss., and taught at Aberdeen Female College. In 1853, Ingraham became a parish priest in Mobile, Ala. A series of fictional letters based on the story of Jesus (which had appeared earlier in an Episcopal magazine) was published in 1855 as <em>The Prince of the House of David</em> and became a bestseller. Ingraham still had financial difficulties, though, and, in 1857, he had to leave Mobile for Riverside, Tenn., where he was the minister of a church and the head of a girls’ school. He returned to Mississippi in 1858, becoming the minister of a church in Holly Springs and the head of a local boys’ school. In the next two years, he published two more Biblical novels and a travel novel. Ingraham died in Holly Springs in December 1860 from an accidental gunshot wound. His son Prentiss was a prolific author of dime novels after the Civil War."

In 1909, she became involved in the woman’s suffrage movement and was a founding member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. Despite her fragile health, Johnston traveled around the region to speak on behalf of the League. She also became interested in Progressive causes such as prison reform and anti-lynching campaigns and in non-orthodox religious movements such as Theosophy. In 1911, Johnston bought property near Germantown, Va. (now Warm Springs). She and her sisters began building a house they named Three Hills.

As a result of this consultation, the Perkins Institution for the Blind sent one of its recent graduates, Anne Sullivan, to the Keller household to teach the child. Sullivan taught her pupil to use the manual alphabet used by the deaf by forming the signs in her hand. Once Keller realized that the mysterious movements were not a game but symbols for real things, the world of language was opened to her.

William B. McClellan. Her early education came from her mother, who died when Idora was fourteen. Moore’s formal education was at the Presbyterian Synodical Collegiate Female Institute of Talladega, Ala., and the Methodist Centenary Institute in Summerfield, Ala., from which she graduated in 1864. She began writing while married to her first husband, a Talladega lawyer. Her first Betsy Hamilton sketch was published in the <em>Talladega News-Reporter</em> in 1873. It was republished extensively and appeared in the <em>New York Sun</em>. After her husband’s death, Moore stayed with a sister in Texas for two years before returning to Talladega. She supported herself by running a sawmill she had inherited from her husband, then by teaching. Moore soon turned to writing as an additional means of support. </p>
<p>In 1881, Moore's first humorous piece appeared in <em>The Sunny South</em>. Some of her pieces were written in “cracker” dialect, while others were in black dialect. Her <em>Sunny South</em> pieces appeared almost weekly. The editor of <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> solicited contributions from her, as well. In 1885, Joel Chandler Harris, author of the “Uncle Remus” stories, introduced her to Henry W. Grady, editor of the <em>Atlanta Constitution</em>, and she became a regular contributor for fifteen years. Grady persuaded Moore that her pieces would be even more effective as spoken word performances, and she began making appearances all over the country. In 1891, she met her second husband during an appearance in Auburn, Ala. She moved to Auburn after their marriage and continued writing and performing. After her husband’s death in 1900, Moore moved back to Talladega where she lived the remainder of her life. A collection of her written pieces was compiled in book form and published in 1921. An abridged version, with some additional pieces, was published posthumously by her stepdaughter in 1937."

In 1892, Moore began writing a weekly column on livestock and literature for the <em>Columbia Herald</em>. He wrote under the pen name of “Trotwood,” later adopting it as his middle name. The following year, Moore began writing a column for <em>Clark’s Horse Review</em>, a national publication based in Chicago. Initially, the subject of his columns was the Tennessee pacer, a harness racing horse, but he later included stories and poems he had written. A collection of Moore’s stories was published in 1897 as <em>Songs and Stories from Tennessee</em>. His first novel, <em>A Summer Hymnal</em>, was published in 1901.

Ryan was born at Hagerstown, Md., where his father worked as a plantation overseer. His family moved to Ralls City, Mo., in 1840, then settled in St. Louis in 1846. Ryan attended Catholic schools and was encouraged to enter the priesthood. He studied theology at the Seminary of Our Lady of Angels (now Niagara University) in western New York State and was ordained a priest in the Vincentian Order in St. Louis in 1860. Traveling on missions for the Vincentians, he developed a reputation as an exciting preacher. However, Ryan’s Confederate sympathies clashed with those of his superiors. In 1862, he left the Order and became a parish priest at St. Mary’s Church in Peoria, Ill. A false story that Ryan was a Confederate spy destroyed his reputation, and he was sent to Tennessee. Ryan did parish work and ministered to Confederate troops, although he never enlisted as an official chaplain. After Lee’s surrender in 1865, Ryan wrote “The Conquered Banner,” the first of his “Lost Cause” poems. In 1867, Ryan was transferred to a parish in Augusta, Ga., where he was a popular speaker and was editor for the Catholic weekly <em>Banner of the South</em>. He used the paper to express his Anti-Reconstruction views, however, and was dismissed from the parish in 1870. </p>
<p>Ryan became a curate of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Mobile, Ala., and also served as editor of the New Orleans diocese newspaper. His health failed, and he spent the winter of 1872/73 recuperating in Italy. Ryan’s bishop then sent him to New York State for a year to do parish fundraising. Back in Mobile, Ryan’s Anti-Reconstruction speeches led to his removal from the diocese newspaper and an end to his political lectures. In 1877, he was made pastor of St. Mary’s Church on the outskirts of Mobile. He collected his poems for publication in book form, and <em>Father Ryan’s Poems</em> was published in Mobile in 1879. A second edition, rearranged and with a new title and several new poems, was published the following year by a Baltimore firm. Travels associated with its publication and with fundraising strained Ryan’s fragile health. He retired from St. Mary’s to live in Biloxi, Miss., where he worked on a devotional book. After its publication, he began traveling again to raise funds for various charities. He was frequently ill, necessitating lengthy visits with friends to recover. Ryan died at a Franciscan monastery in Louisville, Ky., in 1886. His body was returned to Mobile for burial."

Her family moved away when she was two, but they visited on a regular basis, often spending summers with her father's family. Warren's father was a physician in the United States Marine Hospital Service, and the family moved frequently, but, in 1912, they settled in Washington, D.C. Warren showed an early talent for storytelling. However, when she got into trouble for mixing fact with fiction, her father suggested she begin putting her stories into notebooks. Warren attended college at George Washington University and Goucher College, graduating in 1921 with an AB from George Washington. In 1926, Warren published her first novel, the autobiographical <em>A Touch of Earth</em>.  Although it had mixed reviews, an editor at <em>Cosmopolitan</em> obtained the option to publish her short fiction. In the 1920s and 1930s, Warren wrote and published short stories in nationally distributed magazines and wrote freelance articles for three Washington, D.C., newspapers. </p>
<p>Warren's father wanted her to write a book based in Alabama, and, in 1927, she began researching and planning a trilogy based on her father's family and their lives in Clayton. Warren's efforts were delayed for two years in the early 1930s due to a serious illness, but she resumed work on the book after her recovery. In 1936, Warren and her family lived for a year in Clayton, which allowed her to research the Warren family history and the history of the locality. Her novel <em>Foundation Stone</em> was published in 1940 and was an immediate success, widely compared to <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. After the publicity tours, Warren returned to Washington, D.C., and began working on the second book of her proposed trilogy, <em>Whetstone Walls</em>, which was published in 1952. Although Warren continued to write essays, short stories, and novels, she did not publish after 1953. She worked on the third book of her trilogy for thirty years but was unable to complete it before her death in 1982.

Washington was born a slave on a small plantation in southwestern Virginia. After the Civil War, the family moved to Malden, W.Va., to join his stepfather. Washington worked in a salt furnace and coal mines to help support his family and attended night classes whenever possible. After learning about the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute (now Hampton University), a school in Virginia that allowed black students to work for their education, he made his way there, largely by walking and hitching rides. He graduated from Hampton with a BA in 1875 and returned home to teach school in Malden. He also spent a year at Wayland Seminary in Washington, DC, where he earned an MA in 1879 before returning to Hampton as a teacher. </p>
<p>In 1881, Washington went to Tuskegee, Ala., to found a school similar to Hampton Institute. When he arrived, there were many eager students, but no land, buildings, teachers, or money to start the school. After securing buildings for temporary classrooms, he established the school following the principles of the Hampton Institute: to promote the dignity of labor and to teach every student a useful trade in addition to more traditional education. His efforts to raise money for the school led him into a public speaking career, which took him around the country and made him a spokesperson for American blacks. He believed that self-reliance and shared knowledge would enable the black race to rise from the degradation into which slavery had placed them. Although his critics accused him of being an “Uncle Tom,” he believed that equal rights would benefit both races but would have to come gradually in order to be accepted."

Weeden demonstrated artistic talent early and was taking lessons from portraitist William Frye before the age of ten. In 1862, Union army forces seized Huntsville. The Weeden home was taken over for Union officers' housing, and the family went to Tuskegee, Ala., to live with relatives. While they were there, Weeden attended Tuskegee Female College (now Huntingdon College in Montgomery). After the war ended, the family returned to Huntsville but suffered financial difficulties. In 1866, Weeden began publishing short stories and essays under the pen name, “Flake White.” She continued to publish under this name for thirty years. Many of these pieces were published in <em>The Christian Observer</em>, a Presbyterian Church periodical. In addition to her publishing, Weeden gave art classes to local girls and painted and sold greeting cards, sometimes composing verses to go in them. </p>  
<p>Weeden’s first portrait of a former slave was painted to illustrate a poem by Sarah Pratt McLean, “De Massa ob de Sheepfol’.” She began painting the black servants of her family and friends and sometimes wrote verses to accompany the portraits. In 1893, Weeden went to the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago to exhibit some of her work. Her friend Elizabeth Price also exhibited some of Weeden's work in a Nashville music studio and at a Berlin gallery. A private publisher arranged to produce a booklet of her paintings and their accompanying poems. <em>Shadows on the Wall</em> was published in 1898. Soon after a second edition was printed, the press burned, destroying the book’s plates. An expanded version was published as <em>Bandanna Ballads</em> by Doubleday & McClure Company in 1899. Weeden’s health was precarious all her life, and at some point she contracted tuberculosis. Her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she was only able to produce two more books before her death in 1905."

They moved to Hawaii when she was five, Camp Springs, Md., when she was eight, Charleston, S.C., when she was fifteen, and the Philippines just before her senior year in high school. Wiles spent summers with relatives in Louin, Miss., however, and thought of Mississippi as her home. After graduating from high school, she returned there to attend Jones County Junior College. She left college after her first semester to get married and start a family. Wiles was inspired to become a writer while reading books to her children.

When her father’s business went bankrupt in the 1840s economic depression, the family moved, first to Texas, then to Mobile, Ala., where she spent the rest of her life. Wilson had little formal education, but her mother educated her at home and encouraged intellectual pursuits. She began writing as a way to supplement the family’s income. Her second novel, <em>Beulah</em>, published in 1859, sold well and was well received by critics. Wilson’s Christian faith influenced her writing, which tended to feature virtuous heroines who educated themselves by individual studies and then gave up their studies to accept their roles as Christian wives. </p>
<p>Wilson’s devotion to the Southern cause was so strong that, in 1860, she broke off her engagement to a Northern journalist because of his support for Lincoln. During the Civil War, she wrote for a Mobile newspaper and nursed Confederate soldiers in a hospital she helped organize. Her novel <em>Macaria</em>, which idealized the sacrifices of Confederate women, was so popular that a Union general banned it from his ranks and confiscated and burned copies of it. Her novel <em>St. Elmo</em> was the third most popular nineteenth-century American novel, after <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> and <em>Ben-Hur</em>. In 1868, she married a wealthy older widower and neighbor. She continued to write, in addition to managing his household, but her later novels were not as popular. Wilson died at age seventy-four and was buried in Mobile’s Magnolia Cemetery amid the graves of Confederate soldiers."

Wilson was born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1929. After his parents’ divorce in 1936, Wilson spent most of his childhood living with his father and stepmother. The family moved frequently, making it difficult for Wilson to sustain friendships. He spent much of his free time exploring the natural environment, considering nature to be his first, truest friend. Wilson decided early to become a biologist, but a childhood fishing accident rendered him legally blind in one eye, and he suffered a substantial hearing loss during adolescence. He decided to study organisms that did not require him to have these abilities and became an entomologist, primarily studying ants. </p>
<p>While at the University of Alabama, Wilson made one of the first studies of the fire ant, examining the rate at which it was spreading northward. He went to Harvard University for his PhD studies, primarily because Harvard had the world’s largest collection of ant specimens. In 1956, Wilson became a biology professor at Harvard, and, in 1972, he was appointed Curator of Entomology at its Museum of Comparative Zoology. Wilson has been a pioneer in biogeography (the geographical distribution of species) and sociobiology (which examines genetic bases for animal behavior). He has also been active in the conservation movement, advocating for the preservation of habitat and biodiversity of species. In addition to two Pulitzer Prizes, Wilson has been awarded many medals and prizes, among them a Guggenheim Fellowship (1975), the National Medal of Science (1977), and the Crafoord Prize (1990), which recognizes researchers in scientific fields not eligible for the Nobel Prize."

"Tobias Wolff (June 19, 1945&ndash;present)",https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/wp-content/themes/this-goodly-land/images/wolffto.jpg,"Tobias Wolff was born in Birmingham, Ala. Wolff’s parents separated when he was four, and he moved to Florida with his mother. Six years later, they moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, and then to Seattle, Wash. After Wolff’s mother remarried, they moved to a small town several hours north of Seattle. Wolff’s step-father was abusive, and, in response, Wolff engaged in rebellious behavior. At age fifteen, Wolff spent a summer living with his older brother at their father’s home in the San Diego area. His brother encouraged Wolff in his ambition to become a writer and gave him daily assignments in literature and creative writing. The following year, Wolff used forged documents to obtain a scholarship to the Hill School, a Pennsylvania preparatory school. He was expelled in his senior year for poor academic performance and spent four years in the US Army. He was stationed in Vietnam the last year of his Army service. After his discharge, Wolff traveled to England and decided to enroll at Oxford University. He earned BA and MA degrees in English language and literature in 1972 and 1975, respectively. While in England, Wolff published a novel, <em>Ugly Rumours</em>. </p>
<p>On his return to the United States, Wolff briefly worked as a reporter at <em>The Washington Post</em> before moving to California, where he held a Wallace Stegner fellowship at Stanford University in 1975 and 1976. Wolff’s first published short story, “Smokers,” appeared in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1976. Wolff earned an MA at Stanford University in 1978. He taught briefly at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt., and at Arizona State University before joining the faculty at Syracuse University, where he taught for seventeen years. In 1981, Wolff published <em>In the Garden of the North American Martyrs</em>, a short story collection. Since then, Wolff has published additional story collections, two memoirs, and another novel. A motion picture version of <em>This Boy’s Life</em> was released in 1993. Wolff has received grants from the Mary Roberts Rinehart Fund and the Lila Wallace-<em>Readers’ Digest</em> Foundation, as well as fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.

From 1911 to 1912, Wood practiced law in Birmingham. He was made a judge in 1913 but was soon removed from the bench after running afoul of the political establishment. After an unsuccessful run for city office, Wood moved to New York, where he worked briefly as secretary to novelist Upton Sinclair. From 1914 to 1922, Wood supported himself by working as a teacher while establishing his credentials as a poet. </p>
<p>In 1917, Wood won the Newark [N.J.] 250th Anniversary Prize with his poem, “The Smithy of God.” That same year, his first book of poetry, <em>Glad of Earth</em>, was published. In 1920, Wood’s poem, “Jehovah,” won a prize from the Lyric Society. In the following years, Wood worked at a variety of jobs and wrote prolifically in a wide array of genres, although much of his work was not well received by critics. Wood spent two years as a lecturer on the White Star line of ships. He taught correspondence courses, sang spirituals in concerts and on the radio, and wrote approximately seventy <em>Little Blue Book</em> pamphlets, a series aimed at the American working class. Wood was a Socialist and lectured for the Ingersoll Forum of the American Society for the Advancement of Atheism. He was highly opinionated and seemed to seek out controversy. Wood was a poet of the Romantic school and criticized the newer trend of Realism in poetry. He was active in New York literary society, however, especially the Poetry Society of America. At the age of sixty-two, Wood suffered a stroke at his home in Delansen, N.Y., and died in a hospital in Schenectady."

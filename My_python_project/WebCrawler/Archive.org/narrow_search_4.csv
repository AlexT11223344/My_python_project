In The Road to Middlemarch she writes passionately about her relationship to this remarkable, much-loved Victorian novel, and shows how we can live richer and more fulfilling lives through our profound engagement with great literary works. Published when George Eliot was fifty-one, Middlemarch has at its centre one of literature's most compelling and ill-fated marriages, and some of the most tenderly drawn characters. Its vast canvas incorporates the lives of ordinary people and their most intimate struggles. Virginia Woolf famously described it as 'one of the few English novels written for grown-up people', and Mead explores how the ambitions, dreams and attachments of its characters teach us to value the limitations of our everyday lives. Interweaving readings of Middlemarch with an investigation of George Eliot's unconventional, inspiring life and Mead's reflections on her own youth, relationships and marriage, this is a sensitive work of deep reading and biography, for every lover of literature who cares about why we read books and how they read us",true,2020-06-22 16:03:50,#Null,#Null,[]

1994,Geschichte 1750-1990,Engaging with Shakespeare : responses of George Eliot and other women novelists,"Novy, Marianne, 1945-","Athens, Ga. : University of Georgia Press",English,"In Engaging with Shakespeare, Marianne Novy considers the contributions of women novelists in shaping and responding to Shakespeare's cultural presence. Paying particular attention to issues related to gender or to ideologies of gender - especially the ways in which women writers use Shakespeare's plots of marriage and romantic love, his female characters, and the gender-crossing aspects of his male characters and his image - Novy traces a history of women trying to create a Shakespeare of their own. Charting an alternative course to the one emphasized by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in The Madwoman in the Attic, which portrays the male-authored canon as alienating to women, Novy contends that the responses of women writers to Shakespeare often involve an appropriative creativity, a tradition of reading and rewriting male-authored texts to find their own concerns. After showing that women's fictional experiments as early as the eighteenth century and Jane Austen enter into dialogue with Shakespeare, Novy considers the engagements of women novelists with Shakespeare over the more than 250 years up to the 1990s. She discusses some women novelists' identification with his female characters, and the more surprising occasional identification with his status as an outsider, as well as the many different novelistic transformations of his plots. She also shows that for many women novelists, beginning with Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot, the wide-ranging sympathy associated with Shakespeare could be a congenial ideal - up to a point. Novy demonstrates how Eliot's novels Felix Holt, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda, especially, take on new meanings when seen as in dialogue with Shakespeare. She explores the changes between Eliot's and those of early twentieth-century modernists - Willa Cather, Virginia Woolf and Iris Murdoch - and then marks the emergence of more explicit feminist protest in the works of such novelists as Margaret Drabble and Margaret Atwood. Finally, she discusses recent works by Angela Carter, Nadine Gordimer, Gloria Naylor, and Jane Smiley, as well as Drabble, that engage Shakespeare and contemporary cultural hybridity, thereby repositioning Shakespeare as part of a global multiculturalism",true,2019-09-19 00:24:22,#Null,#Null,"['0820315966', '9780820315966']"

Sawyer provocatively argues that a single cultural context may produce diametrically opposed readings of the playwright, so at the same time that Shakespeare's cultural status may be used to subvert traditional ideas of politics and letters in George Eliot and A.C. Swinburne, it may also be used to promote more conservative policies and literary interpretations in other writers such as Robert Browning and Charles Dickens."" ""By focusing on four important authors in the mid-Victorian period working in three different genres, this book illustrates how Shakespeare's authority continued to affect many authors during a time in history where a society is redefining itself in terms of gender, culture, subjectivity, and the family.

1991,"LITERARY CRITICISM -- European -- English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh","George Eliot and Herbert Spencer : feminism, evolutionism, and the reconstruction of gender","Paxton, Nancy L., 1949- author","Princeton, New Jersey : Princeton University Press",English,"This analysis of the writings of two major Victorian intellectuals examines the crucial place of gender in the larger Victorian debate about nature, religion, and evolutionary theory. Demonstrating the primacy of Herbert Spencer's influence on George Eliot's thought, Nancy Paxton discloses the continuous dialogue between this profoundly learned novelist and one of the most formidable and influential scientific authorities of her time. Using rarely cited first editions of Spencer's published works, Paxton reveals that Eliot and Spencer initially agreed in supporting several of the goals of early Victorian feminism when they met in 1851. Paxton surveys all of Spencer's writing to show when and why he repudiated his early feminism and demonstrates Eliot's determined resistance to the most conservative tendencies of evolutionary theory in her representation of female sexuality, motherhood, feminist ambition, and desire. In comparing Eliot's and Spencer's evolutionary ""reconstruction of gender,"" the book draws on a wide variety of biographical, literary, and critical texts and on interdisciplinary scholarship about the relation between scientific and literary discourse in the nineteenth century. By thus reassessing Eliot's contribution to feminist thought, it presents a revolutionary reading of her novels which is informed by contemporary feminist criticism and the new historicism. ""This is an important book because of the questions it raises, the issues it covers, and the illumination it brings to Eliot and Spencer and to crucial problems in the nineteenth century: Paxton looks at the ways scientific data get turned into arguments about the nature of women in society, about women and education, about women and sexuality.

There is in England no more real or typical district than Thomas Hardy's imaginary Wessex, the scattered fields and farms of which were first discovered in Far from the Madding Crowd. It is here that Gabriel Oak observes Bathsheba, the young mistress of Weatherbury Farm, fall victim to her amorous caprices. He stands by her through one marriage to a handsome, corruptly sentimental sergeant. Selflessly altruistic, he sees her through another betrothal to her compulsive, puritanical neighbor-as unaware as she of the stroke of Fate that will effect their ultimate union. Published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, Far from the Madding Crowd won Hardy immediate success; it combines an architecturally perfect plot with the philosophical overtones that were to set the theme for all his later works. The text of this Signet Classic is set from Hardy's revised final version of Far from the Madding Crowd , published in 1912 in the authoritative Wessex edition",true,2021-08-14 13:00:56,#Null,#Null,[]

Dinitia Smith's spellbinding novel recounts George Eliot's honeymoon in Venice in June 1880 following her marriage to a handsome young man twenty years her junior. When she agreed to marry John Walter Cross, Eliot was recovering from the death of George Henry Lewes, her beloved companion of twenty-six years. Eliot was bereft: left at the age of sixty to contemplate profound questions about her physical decline, her fading appeal, and the prospect of loneliness. In her youth, Mary Ann Evans--who would later be known as George Eliot--was a country girl, considered too plain to marry, so she educated herself in order to secure a livelihood. In an era when female novelists were objects of wonder, she became the most famous writer of her day--with a male nom de plume. The Honeymoon explores different kinds of love, and of the possibilities of redemption and happiness even in an imperfect union. Smith integrates historical truth with her own rich rendition of Eliot's inner voice, crafting a page-turner that is as intelligent as it is gripping""--

These expectations were expressed through a wide range of media including maternal guidebooks, popular periodicals, and Queen Victoria's maternal image. In Suffering Mothers in Mid-Victorian Novels, Natalie McKnight analyzes the influence of such cultural pressures on the fictional portrayals of mothers in mid-Victorian novels. Using a new historical and psychoanalytic approach, McKnight examines the climate created by a society that idolized mothers in theory but in reality positioned them to fail. The novels of Dickens, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, and George Eliot are studied for their inclusion of mother characters who vary from the ambivalent to the monstrous, the angelic to the absent",true,2020-08-11 05:05:02,#Null,#Null,[]

Eugene Hollahan has studied the history of this important word within the development of the English-language novel, from Samuel Richardson to Saul Bellow. After establishing a heuristic model for such a critical history, Hollahan tracks the word (characterized by George Eliot in Felix Holt, the Radical as a ""great noun"") through two-and-a-half centuries of narratives by major novelists, with contextualizing excursions into discourses in related fields such as autobiography, philosophy, theology, and social science. Hollahan contextualizes his study of English-language narrative fiction by examining the writings of crisis-rhetoricians in the eighteenth century (Thomas Paine), nineteenth century (Thomas Carlyle, J.S. Mill, and J.H. Newman), and twentieth century (Karl Barth, Edmund Husserl, T.S. Kuhn, and Richard M. Nixon). Such varied and powerful crisis-rhetorics establish a matrix of language and ideas for the crisis-centered novels Hollahan surveys. These novels include major works by Samuel Richardson, Walter Scott, Jane Austen, George Eliot, George Meredith, George Gissing, George Moore, D.H. Lawrence, E.M. Forster, James Joyce, Lawrence Durrell, Robert Coover, and Saul Bellow. Hollahan's description of the crisis-trope interfaces with various critical issues such as canonical inclusion, reader response, and deconstruction. On the whole, his book acknowledges current critical issues but endeavors to remain basically a critical history. It attempts to demonstrate that the crisis-riddled modern world and the crisis-conscious novel are analogous and coeval. Crisis begins as Aristotle's term for logical plot structuring, becomes Longinus's term for emotional exacerbation, and eventually enters into a variety of critical and narrative formulations: Matthew Arnold's cultural centrality, Henry James's existential aestheticism, Lawrence's self-defining sexuality, Marshall Brown's revolutionary turning point, Paul de Man's error-ridden criticism, Floyd Merrell's cut into the primordial flux, Durrell's reborn self, and Bellow's analysis of hysterical escapism. Broadly speaking, Hollahan argues that any crisis-trope will enable or even necessitate a unique confluence of writerly and readerly skills. In Louis Lambert, Balzac urged: ""What a wonderful book one would write by narrating the life and adventures of a word."" The story Hollahan narrates fulfills Balzac's expectations as it depicts writer after writer working out influential representations of human life in terms of crisis-consciousness centering upon George Eliot's ""great noun"" crisis. Historically, Hollahan demonstrates, such consciousness comes to define modern humanity",true,2020-08-11 07:51:12,#Null,#Null,"['0874134455', '9780874134452']"

1992,English literature -- Women authors -- History and criticism,Femininity to feminism : women and literature in the nineteenth century,"Gorsky, Susan Rubinow",New York : Twayne ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York : Maxwell Macmillan International,English,"The nineteenth century, a period marked by intense social, economic, and intellectual ferment, spawned the creation of lively and varied literary works by women. The writings of artists who were also social commentators--the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, Harriet Martineau, George Eliot, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Kate Chopin--to name only a few--provide a vivid portrait of a tumultuous century. Most literary histories of the period have highlighted men's interpretations of the events and issues of the time, and have focused primarily on the public (and therefore predominantly male) social sphere. The facts of women's experience in this century, and of their increasingly public struggle to define themselves as whole and independent beings, has not been thoroughly examined in relation to their literary creation. In Femininity to Feminism, Susan Rubinow Gorsky combines social history research--including statistics about family life, women's education, and women in the work force--with an examination of the way these issues are presented in literature by and about women. Gorsky's work illuminates women's lives and writings in relation to the cultural attitudes that influenced their creation. Focusing on the intensity of women's struggle to find their own literary and political voices and to be heard in the public sphere, Gorsky traces the emergence of a shared self-consciousness that began to express itself in literary and social resistance to patriarchy. Her study looks at both male and female writers, examining works by such prominent authors as Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Louisa May Alcott, as well as by Charlotte Yonge, Sarah Grand, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, and Elizabeth Gaskell--authors popular at the time but rarely read in the twentieth century--to provide a complete, balanced, and accurate portrait of how women's experience was utilized and transformed for literary purposes. The volume is foreworded by noted feminist scholar Nancy Walker. A lively, accessible, and thoroughly informed study of women's history and literature in the nineteenth century, Femininity to Feminism provides an enriching synthesis of the social and literary issues affecting women of the time",true,2020-10-01 13:04:23,#Null,#Null,"['0805789758', '9780805789751', '0805789782', '9780805789782']"

2004,"Malone, Nancy M",Walking a literary labyrinth : a spirituality of reading,"Malone, Nancy M",New York : Riverhead Books,English,"Reflecting on her own reading life, Nancy Malone examines the role that reading plays in defining ourselves. Throughout, she likens the experience of reading to walking a labyrinth, itself a metaphor for our journeys through life. The paths within the labyrinth are not straight, but winding, and in the end, it is not the small circle in the center that defines the self, but the whole grand design of the labyrinth-every experience, every person we meet, and every book we read-that makes us who we are. Malone draws from diverse sources, both spiritual and secular-Augustine, George Herbert, George Eliot, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke, Virginia Woolf, Paul Tillich, Elie Wiesel, James Agee, E.E. Cummings, Tom Wolfe, Patrick O'Brien, Nadine Gordimer, Margaret Atwood and Sue Grafton, to name a few. The author's analysis of influential books covers a broad range of subjects, including childhood reading; books as sacred objects; reading and social responsibility; ""dangerous"" reading (that challenges us to examine our prejudices and beliefs); poetry; and erotic literature. The book includes a bibliography to inspire readers to seek out the unfamiliar or return to old favorites. In Walking a literary labyrinth, Malone invites readers of all religious traditions, or none, to consider the influence of reading in their own lives

The result is a new kind of literary work for the age of digital and social media, one that reimagines the essay's efforts, at least since Montaigne, to understand our common condition by trying to understand ourselves. Ranging widely, the essays often begin with a quotation from one of Nunokawa's favorite writers--George Eliot, Henry James, Gerard Manley Hopkins, W.H. Auden, Robert Frost, or James Merrill, to name a few. At other times, Nunokawa is just as likely to be discussing Joni Mitchell or Spanish soccer striker Fernando Torres.

This book by Roger Gard is at once a thoughtful and detailed discussion of Jane Austen's oeuvre and a provocative and witty commentary that will stimulate all readers. Gard offers lively and perceptive discussions of the six major novels, together with the early Lady Susan and the unfinished Sanditon. The precise nature and scope of Jane Austen's realism, her particularly English approach to the world, and the characteristic blend in her work of a sharp scepticism about human nature and its banality with an idealism about human virtue are theses that recur throughout Gard's study. The book is moreover notable for the original and striking links it makes between Jane Austen and other authors ranging from Shakespeare to Flaubert, Lawrence, George Eliot and Barbara Pym.

What was so dangerous about this artistic, tempestuous royal that her life has been documented more by rumour and gossip than hard facts? When Lucinda Hawksley started to investigate, often thwarted by inexplicable secrecy, she discovered a fascinating woman, modern before her time, whose story has been shielded for years from public view. Louise was a sculptor and painter, friend of the Pre-Raphaelites and a keen member of the Aesthetic movement. The most feisty of the Victorian princesses, she kicked against her mother's controlling nature and remained fiercely loyal to her brothers - especially the sickly Leopold and the much-maligned Bertie. She sought out other unconventional women, including Josephine Butler and George Eliot, and campaigned for education and health reform and for the rights of women. She battled with her mother for permission to practice the 'masculine' art of sculpture and to go to art college - and in doing so became the first British princess to attend a public school. The rumours of Louise's colourful love life persist even today, with hints of love affairs dating as far back as her teenage years, and notable scandals included entanglements with her sculpting tutor Joseph Edgar Boehm and possibly even her sister Princess Beatrice's handsome husband, Liko. True to revellious form, she refused all royal suitors and became the first member of the royal family to marry a commoner since the sixteenth century and moved with him to Canada when he was appointed Governor-General""--Jacket",true,2021-10-29 13:06:30,#Null,#Null,[]

She had advanced ideas on education and her attitudes to single motherhood, family responsibilities, working life, domestic affections, the importance of friendship and sexual relationships now look astonishingly modern. She tested the new ways man and woman might live together. 'Imagination must lead the senses, not the senses the imagination, ' she told her lover, Gilbert Imlay, and repeated to her husband, William Godwin."" ""And though she died young, her new genus lived on in the lives of her daughters and immediate heirs, Mary Shelley, Fanny Imlay, Claire Clairmont, Margaret Mount Cashell, and later again in women such as George Eliot and Virginia Woolf."" ""Yet, from the time of her death in 1797 until now, she has acquired a reputation of being unstable and loose, a wild woman doomed to extinction. Lyndall Gordon's biography, the first to enter into the full scope of her brave and exhilarating experiment, probes these myths and vindicates her life in accord with Wollstonecraft's own values."" ""This account covers her period as a governess to the aristocracy in Ireland; as self-supporting writer in London; as on-the-scene observer of the French Revolution; and as a daring traveller to Scandinavia on the trail of an unsolved crime: the disappearance of a cargo of Bourbon silver.

In the course of the book, she charts her own development as a feminist, demonstrates ways of understanding the dynamics of gender and genre, and traces the redefinitions of maternity reflected in texts by authors such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning and George Eliot. Throughout, Gilbert asks major questions about feminism in the twentieth century: Why and how did its ideas become so necessary to women in the sixties and seventies? What have those feminist concepts come to mean in the new century? And above all, how have our intellectual mothers shaped our thoughts today?",true,2014-06-03 13:44:42.227457,#Null,#Null,[]

2015,Fiction -- 19th century -- History and criticism,The antinomies of realism,"Jameson, Fredric, author",London ; New York : Verso,English,"""The Antinomies of Realism is a history of the nineteenth-century realist novel and its legacy told without a glimmer of nostalgia for artistic achievements that the movement of history makes it impossible to recreate. The works of Zola, Tolstoy, Perez Galdos, and George Eliot are in the most profound sense inimitable, yet continue to dominate the novel form to this day. Novels to emerge since struggle to reconcile the social conditions of their own creation with the history of this mode of writing: the so-called modernist novel is one attempted solution to this conflict, as is the ever-more impoverished variety of commercial narratives - what today's book reviewers dub ""serious novels,"" which are an attempt at the impossible endeavor to roll back the past. Fredric Jameson examines the most influential theories of artistic and literary realism, approaching the subject himself in terms of the social and historical preconditions for realism's emergence. The realist novel combined an attention to the body and its states of feeling with a focus on the quest for individual realization within the confines of history. In contemporary writing, other forms of representation - for which the term ""postmodern"" is too glib - have become visible: for example, in the historical fiction of Hilary Mantel or the stylistic plurality of David Mitchell's novels. Contemporary fiction is shown to be conducting startling experiments in the representation of new realities of a global social totality, modern technological warfare, and historical developments that, although they saturate every corner of our lives, only become apparent on rare occasions and by way of the strangest formal and artistic devices. In a coda, Jameson explains how ""realistic"" narratives survived the end of classical realism. In effect, he provides an argument for the serious study of popular fiction and mass culture that transcends lazy journalism and the easy platitudes of recent cultural studies.--",true,2021-10-23 09:09:00,#Null,#Null,[]

What is its relation to literary theory? In Theory and the Evasion of History, David Ferris ranges from the philosophical writings of Plato and Aristotle to nineteenth-century criticism, poetry, and fiction to examine the relation of literature to history as a subject of both theoretical and thematic importance. Focusing on the intellectual debts of the literary interpretations of Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Eliot, Ferris identifies an ""evasion"" that literary history and literary theory cannot help but perform if they are to maintain themselves as disciplines. ""The evasion,"" he writes, ""may be quite readily discerned in those shifts which are traditionally evoked by literary history in order to distinguish ... an Aristotelian from a Romantic model of literature or even a shift from Romanticism's preoccupations with imagination, language, and literary tradition to the social and historical concerns which tend to dominate the interpretation of a narrative such as George Eliot's Middlemarch."" In examining these shifts, Ferris identifies an essential pattern that informs not only the various theoretical and critical positions adopted in the name of deconstruction but also the historical critiques of these positions. He then points out the difficulty of developing a deconstructive criticism unmarked by a predicament that defines the course of literary history. In Ferris's reading, the evasion of such a predicament enables the history that such a criticism would deconstruct",true,2020-08-17 18:06:15,#Null,#Null,"['0801845041', '9780801845048']"

For Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims, for artists, musicians, and writers, and for women and men everywhere she has shown many faces and personified a variety of virtues. In this important book, a world-renowned scholar who is the author of numerous books - including the best-selling Jesus Through the Centuries - tells how Mary has been depicted and venerated through the ages. Jaroslav Pelikan examines the biblical portrait of Mary, analyzing both the New and Old Testaments to see how the bits of information provided about her were expanded into a full-blown doctrine. He explores the view of Mary in late antiquity, where the differences between Mary, the mother of Christ, and Eve, the ""mother of all living,"" provided positive and negative symbols of women. He discusses how the Eastern church commemorated Mary and how she was portrayed in the Holy Qur'an of Islam",true,2021-04-16 10:00:56,#Null,#Null,"['0300069510', '9780300069518', '0300076614', '9780300076615']"

The first edition of Strauss' book was published in Germany in 1835 when he was only 27 years old, and which by 1840 had gone through four editions. He focused his attention on battling two theological fronts which were current at the time - the traditional Orthodox who believed the miracles in the Gospels were to be taken as literal, yet supernatural, history; and the Rationalists, who believed that the Gospel miracles were all true but could be explained by natural and purely physical causes. Strauss rejected both camps and, in a scrupulous and detailed historical analysis of the Gospels, concluded that the Gospels are historically unreliable, not because the Evangelists were deceptive, but because they were preachers who wrote their Gospels as convictions of Faith in a mythological framework. Strauss further argued that anything that can be known of the Historical Jesus is hopelessly buried under accretions of legend and myth.",#Null,2012-01-28 01:49:28,/compress/life_of_jesus_1201_librivox/formats=OGG VORBIS&file=/life_of_jesus_1201_librivox.zip,/download/life_of_jesus_1201_librivox/__ia_thumb.jpg,[]

1992,Science Fiction - Anthologies,"The Lifted veil : the book of fantastic literature by women, 1800-World War II","Williams, A. Susan",New York : Carroll & Graf,English,"""As more and more writers and readers are drawn to the fantastic, this is perhaps an opportune moment to assess and to celebrate the part that women have played in its development."" ""For women's contributions to this genre, which now includes science fiction, stories of ghosts and the supernatural, fairy tales, stories of magic and terror, and weird horror, have been considerable and indeed seminal. Most critics now agree that it was Mary Shelley who with Frankenstein invented what we now call science fiction, while Ann Radcliffe's novels of the 1790s sparked the immense vogue for Gothic; in the nineteenth century the same imaginative strain runs through Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, and Catherine Crowe's The Night Side of Nature began a vogue for ghost and horror stories that has never subsequently diminished."" ""The Lifted Veil is the first substantial collection of women's fantasy writing from these beginnings to modern times, and it includes as wealth of wondrous stories by the women who did so much to shape the course of fantastic fiction, including rarities by Mary Shelley, Louisa May Alcott (writing under the pseudonym 'A. M. Barnard'), Charlotte Bronte and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Also included are intriguing tales by E. Nesbit, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Willa Cather, Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf and a host more. Finally, the modern age of fantasy is prefigured in works by May Sinclair, C.L. Moore, Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) and Margery Lawrence, the book closing at the watershed of World War II. (A second volume of contemporary stories is planned)."" ""With a scholarly introduction and notes by the editor, A. Susan Williams, The Lifted Veil defines and reveals the special talent that women have for fantastic writing in a volume that will become the standard collection for students and readers alike.""--Jacket
